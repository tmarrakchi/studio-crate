Avoid various obstacles such as brick walls and steel walls, and use your powerful combat power to repel the blocked enemies, ride the wind and waves all the way to accumulate strength, and break through the obstacles at the bottom of the game to get higher points rewards. The seemingly simple gameplay has become a favorite of level parkour enthusiasts and players with specific roles because of the muscular muscular man's theme and the skin of sportsmen such as the Hulk.

        "text": "From the actual experience, the biggest difference between Muscle Rush and Hair Challenge is the gendered role, which is the difference developed in the game. Compared with the shortcomings that the hair is not carried after being extended, it is easy to be destroyed. Strong muscles are more likely to be retained until the end of the suspension, thereby gaining higher points. On the other hand, in the process of closing the bottom, Muscle Rush has also greatly reduced the two gameplay methods of hitting the wall and fighting against the wrist. The single measurement value of games such as Hair Challenge gives players a sense of homogeneity and enhances the player's gaming experience."
