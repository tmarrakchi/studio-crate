Nevertheless, we will soon offer an in-game shop where players can purchase either in-game currency or permanent booster for a few bucks, which can be done through the game itself. The purchases will be handled entirely by iTunes and Google Play, in order to ensure the safety of your personal and financial information. It is very important for us to give all our players the ability to choose how they would like to play the game, therefore every area of the game is equally accessible to players as they progress, regardless of whether they invest real money into it or not. Also, we're offering optional & non-intrusive advertisement videos, that can be watched to gain some in-game resources as reward. The rewards will scale with your progress.",
